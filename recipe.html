    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (roughly 500g)</li>
        <li>250ml buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil, plus enough for deep frying</li>
        <li>1 red onion, finely sliced</li>
        <li>2 red chillies, finely sliced</li>
        <li>50g cornflour</li>
        <li>50g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>4 seeded brioche buns, sliced</li>
        <li>3 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>½ iceberg lettuce, finely sliced</li>
        <li>3 tbsp barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>4 slices Gouda cheese</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the chicken seasoning until well combined then stir in the chicken to evenly coat. </li>

        <li>Once seasoned, add the buttermilk, making sure the thighs are well covered. For the best results, leave overnight, but if this is not possible, leave to marinate for a minimum of 2-4 hours. Allow the chicken thighs to get to room temperature before cooking. </li>
        <li>When you are ready to cook, add 1 tbsp of oil to a pan over a medium heat then add the red onion and chillies and allow them to cook down and soften. This should take 6-8 mins. </li>
        <li>Mix the corn flour, plain flour, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic granules and dried basil together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Fill a deep-set frying pan, or cast-iron skillet fill with 10cm of oil and heat to 165°C. You can also use a deep fryer for optimal temperature control. </li>
        <li>One by one, coat each thigh in the flour, making sure the thigh is fully floured. Leave on a wire rack while you flour each thigh.</li>
        <li>Gently place the thigh in the oil by laying it into the oil away from you. If using a pan or cast-iron skillet, cook on each side for 5-6 mins. If using a deep fryer, cook for 6-8 mins. </li>
        <li>You can use a food probe to check the thigh is cooked all the way through. You should aim for 87°C-90°C to know it's cooked. If you don't have a probe, use a skewer to pierce the meat to check that the juices run clear. If juices are still pink, cook for a few mins more. Once cooked, leave to rest on a rack.</li>
        <li>Heat the grill to medium and toast the buns until golden.</li>
        <li>Now build the burger. Add mayo on the bottom bun, then add shredded lettuce. Place the chicken on top, and then the onions and chillies. Top with a generous dollop of barbecue sauce and then place a slice of Gouda on top. </li>
        <li>Leave under the grill for 1-2 mins to allow the cheese to melt. </li>
        <li>Place the top bun on and enjoy.</li>
